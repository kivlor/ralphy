## Codebase Patterns


## January 16, 2026 - Scaffold backend for file I/O and process control

- Added a minimal Node HTTP backend for tasks/progress I/O and runner control with SSE logs.
- Files changed: index.js, scripts/ralph/tasks.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: SSE via `/api/runner/logs` for live log streaming.
  - Gotchas encountered: Runner start uses shell mode when no args are provided.
